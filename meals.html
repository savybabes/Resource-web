    <h2>Ackee and Salt fish </h2>
    <h3> Surprising Truths:</h3>
    <p>Ackee and saltfish is Jamaica’s national dish, prepared with fresh herbs and peppers. 
        It is typically served with yam, plantain, green banana, dumplings, and breadfruit.
        Saltfish, sourced from the seas of Northern Europe, was combined with ackee, a fruit native to West Africa.
        Ackee was brought to Jamaica from Ghana during the transatlantic slave trade between Britain, West Africa, 
        and the Caribbean in the 18th and 19th centuries.

            <h3>Surprising Truths:</h3>
            <p>In the early 19th century, Indian labourers working on sugar plantations brought roti to the Caribbean, 
                including Trinidad and Tobago. Over time, Caribbean people enhanced the recipe, making it more flavorful. 
                In Trinidad and Tobago, the original roti evolved into 'dhalpuri' by incorporating split peas as a key ingredient. </p>

            <h2>Jerk Chicken</h2>
            <h3>Surprising Truths:</h3>
            <p>Jerk chicken originated in Jamaica when the Maroons introduced African cooking techniques. 
                It combines these techniques with native Jamaican ingredients and Arawak Indian seasonings. 
                The term 'jerk' comes from the Spanish adaptation of the Peruvian word 'charqui,' which means dried strips of meat.

        <h2>Oxtail</h2>
        <h3>Surprising Truths:</h3>
        <p>Oxtail stew traces its origins back to Jamaica’s colonial heritage. It originated during slavery when enslaved 
            Africans on plantations were given limited and inexpensive cuts of meat.
            As a result, they resourcefully created flavorful dishes using scrap pieces from slaughtered animals. 
            This culinary tradition continues today, with many Jamaican dishes incorporating chicken feet, 
            pig’s tail, cow’s foot, goat head, liver, and kidney.

                    <h2>Run Down</h2>
                    <h3>Surprising Truths:</h3>
                    <p>Run Dun originated in Jamaica and was exported to Latin America by the Afro-Caribbean 
                        workers who migrated there in the early 19th century. 
                        Those who migrated there worked on the Panama Canal and Costa Rican Railroad. 
                        The dish is mainly consumed in small areas of islands such as Tobago, 
                        and South and Central America. With two main accessible ingredients fish and coconut milk in
                        Jamaican Patois run dun describes the “liquefied” nature of the sauce in the dish.
